üîç What to check:

1. Did your browser open automatically?
2. Did you see WhatsApp Web load?
3. If you weren't logged in, did you scan the QR code?
4. Did you receive a message on your phone?

If you didn't receive the message:
- Check if you entered your phone number correctly
- Make sure you're logged into WhatsApp Web
- Try running the test again

Next steps:
- If it worked: Set BOT_MODE=scheduler for daily messages
- If it didn't work: Double-check your phone number format
