- `mitzvah_bot_lambda.zip` - Ready-to-deploy Lambda package
- `create_lambda_package.bat` - Package creation script
- `docs/AWS_LAMBDA_SETUP.md` - Lambda deployment guide
- `docs/SCHEDULE_SETUP.md` - Daily scheduling configuration
- `MitzvosMasterList.csv` - Complete 613 mitzvot reference
- `Schedule.csv` - 354-day mitzvah schedule (embedded in bot)
- `requirements.txt` - Lambda dependencies only

### **Archived Files** (Moved to `archive/`)

- Old bot implementations (Railway, Telegram, WhatsApp Web)

## 🎯 **What's Left**

The repository now contains only:

1. **Working Lambda function** ✅
2. **Deployment package** ✅
3. **Essential documentation** ✅
