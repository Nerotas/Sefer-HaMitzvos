üîç How to get your WhatsApp Group ID:

Method 1 - From Browser Console:
1. Open WhatsApp Web (web.whatsapp.com) in your browser
2. Open the group chat you want to send messages to
3. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
4. Go to the Console tab
5. Type: Store.Chat.getActive().id._serialized
6. Press Enter
7. Copy the ID (something like: "1234567890-1234567890@g.us")

Method 2 - From Invite Link:
Your current group ID: "JpwWqLb9Dv0K8KUQsX3KcO"
This looks like it's from an invite link, but you need the actual chat ID.

Method 3 - Test with a Simple Message:
If you're not sure, try sending to your own phone number first:
1. Replace group_id with your phone number (format: "+1234567890")
2. Use send_to_individuals() instead of send_to_group()
